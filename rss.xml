            <title><![CDATA[Innanet James “Summer” (Review)]]></title>
            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Innanet James “Summer” (Review)</h1><p>Summer's clichés are just as important as its realities. As long as we hope and believe that it's endless, breezy, and free—that each day could very well be the best one yet—then summer will continue to captivate. Maryland rapper Innanet James' "Summer" sounds just how we think the season should. G-funk synths (courtesy of the Kount's "Hey" instrumental) are blown out to beam with absolute joy. The song constantly moves while staying relaxed enough to bask in its own warmth.</p><img src="https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/e6097808-ca1e-4d7e-adaf-502f031cbc01.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>MTV ArtistBETA "NSM3" Available on www.iamacehigh.com</h1><p>Richie Acevedo (native Milwaukee) began to buzz in his career during 2014 after a recent move to Seattle proved to be fortuitous. Starting with no help, he managed to grow his brand into a town favorite, and eventually linked up with OFMG (One Famm Music Group) to form the sound that lead to his project “SpaceShips and Paper Planes”, a brilliant follow-up to his “Basquiat” mixtape, the latter of which set him apart from his peers and contemporaries. His performance in Summer Jam 2015 boasted a festival audience of over 20,000. Career highlights include the 2016 Sosua Beach Fest (Dominican Republic), 2015 Grammys, Seattle Folk Life Festival and The West Coast Hip-Hop Awards to name a few.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/e28c2efe855201e76c0bfa3098135d73e15c1a1b.png"></article>]]></description>

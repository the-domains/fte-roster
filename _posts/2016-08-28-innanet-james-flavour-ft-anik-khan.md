  Innanet James and Anik Khan are two of the most dynamic artists of this
  generation, and make for an unexpectedly fire combo on their hot-off-the-press
  new collab "Flavour." It comes from James' upcoming Quebec Place project, and
  is an incredibly vibrant and feel-good record, with uptempo electronic
  production paving the way for their contrasting vocals and styles to mesh
  wonderfully, all piecing together for a homerun hit.

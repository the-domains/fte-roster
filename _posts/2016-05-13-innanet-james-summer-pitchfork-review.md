## Innanet James "Summer" Pitchfork (Review) 

Summer's clichés are just as important as its realities. As long as we hope and believe that it's endless, breezy, and free---that each day could very well be the best one yet---then summer will continue to captivate. Maryland rapperInnanet James' "Summer" sounds just how we think the season should. G-funk synths (courtesy of the Kount's "Hey" instrumental) are blown out to beam with absolute joy. The song constantly moves while staying relaxed enough to bask in its own warmth.

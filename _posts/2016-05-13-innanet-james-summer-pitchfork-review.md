  Summer's clichés are just as important as its realities. As long as we hope
  and believe that it's endless, breezy, and free—that each day could very well
  be the best one yet—then summer will continue to captivate. Maryland rapper
  Innanet James' "Summer" sounds just how we think the season should. G-funk
  synths (courtesy of the Kount's "Hey" instrumental) are blown out to beam with
  absolute joy. The song constantly moves while staying relaxed enough to bask
  in its own warmth.
